REM The flow control statement IF will determine whether or not to execute its block of code based on the evaluation of an expression. One way to interpret an IF statement is to read it as "IF this condition is true, THEN do this".REM The IF statement consists of these partsREM - The IF keywordREM - The condition, or expression that evaluates to TRUE or FALSEREM - In most cases, the expression is surrounded by parenthesis ( )REM - The THEN keywordREM - One or more newlines containing the block of code to executeREM - The END_IF keywordREM Example IF THEN$FOO = 42$BAR = 1337IF ( $FOO < $BAR ) THEN  STRING 42 is less than 1337END_IFREM The expression "Is 42 less than 1337" is evaluated and determined to be TRUE.REM Because the IF condition is TRUE, the code between the keywords THEN and END_IF are executed.REM The string "42 is less than 1337" is typed.
