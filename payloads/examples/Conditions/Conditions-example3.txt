REM A nested IF statement is quite simply an IF statement placed inside another IF statement. Nested IF statements may be used when evaluating a combination of conditions.REM Example nested IF statementsIF ( $_CAPSLOCK_ON == TRUE ) THEN    IF ( $_NUMLOCK_ON == TRUE ) THEN        STRING Both Capslock and Numlock are on!    END_IFEND_IFREM The condition of the first IF statement is evaluated — whether or not the target has reported that the caps lock key is on. If it is TRUE, then the nested IF statement will run.
REM The second IF statement is evaluated much like the first, only this time checking the status of the num lock key.
REM If both the capslock and numlock keys have been reported by the target as being on, then the string "Both Capslock and Numlock are on!" will be typed.
