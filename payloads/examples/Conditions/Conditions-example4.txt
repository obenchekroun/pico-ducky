REM In some cases it may be more efficient to use logical operators within a single IF statement, rather than using a nested IF structure. REM Example IF statement with logical operatorsIF (( $_CAPSLOCK_ON == TRUE ) && ( $_NUMLOCK_ON == TRUE )) THEN    STRING Both Capslock and Numlock are on!END_IFREM Because the AND logical operator is in use, the whole condition will only evaluate as TRUE if both sub conditions are TRUE.
REM Similar to the Nested IF example, the string "Both Capslock and Numlock are on!" will only be typed if both capslock and numlock are reported by the target as being on.
