REM The order of operations (order precedence) are a set of rules that define which procedures are performed first in order to evaluate an expression, similar to that of mathematics.REM In DuckyScript, parenthesis ( ) are required to define the precedence conventions. VAR $FOO = ( 4 * 10 ) + 2REM The expression ( 4 * 10 ) evalues to 40. REM The expression 40 + 2 evalues to 42.REM If multiple pairs of parentheses are required, the parentheses can be nested. VAR $FOO = 42VAR $BAR = (( 100 * 13 ) + ( $FOO - 5 ))REM The expression 42 - 5 evalues to 37REM The expression ( 100 * 13 ) evalues to 1300REM The expression 1300 + 37 evalues to 1337
