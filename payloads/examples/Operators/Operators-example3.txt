REM Bitwise operators are operators which operate on the uint16 values at the binary level.ATTACKMODE HID STORAGE VID_05AC PID_021EVAR $FOO = $_CURRENT_VIDREM Because VID/PID parameters are little endian, $FOO = ((($FOO >> 8) & 0x00FF) | (($FOO << 8) & 0xFF00))REM $FOO will now equal 0xAC05REM The value of $_CURRENT_VID is saved into the variable $FOO as AC05.REM Using bitwise operators its endianness is swapped to 05AC.
