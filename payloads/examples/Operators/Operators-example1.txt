REM Assign $FOO to 42VAR $FOO = 42REM The variable is now 42. REM Let’s add it by 1.$FOO = ( $FOO + 1 )REM The variable is now 43: the sum of 42 and 1. REM Let’s subtract it by 1.$FOO = ( $FOO - 1 )REM The variable is now 42 (again): REM the difference of 42 and 1. REM Let’s multiply it by 2.$FOO = ( $FOO * 2 )REM The variable is now 84: REM the product of 42 and 2.REM Let’s divide it by 2.$FOO = ( $FOO / 2 )REM The variable is now 42 (again): REM the quotient of 82 and 2.REM Let’s modulus it by 4.$FOO = ( $FOO % 4 )REM The variable is now 2: REM the signed remainder of 42 and 4.REM Let’s raise it to the power of 6.$FOO = ( $FOO ^ 6 )REM Our variable is now 64: REM the exponent of 2 and 6.
