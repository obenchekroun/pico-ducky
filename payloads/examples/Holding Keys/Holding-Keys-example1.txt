REM This example payload targets Windows systems.
REM Using the GUI r key combo to open the Run dialog, a powershell window will be opened.
REM The ALT SPACE key combo opens the window menu of the currently active window (in this case, the powershell window), followed by the m key to select the Move command.
REM The DOWNARROW is held for 3 seconds, as specified by the DELAY 3000 command, before being released — thus hiding the contents of the powershell window below the screen.
REM The benign tree c:\ command is run, producing a graphical directory structure of the disk.
