Requirements: DuckyScript 3.0, PayloadStudio v. 1.3.0 minimum</p>

**What is ReverseDuckyPolymorph?**
#
*One of the biggest problems when publishing payloads, exploits, POCs, etc. is static detection. If X hundred or thousand people use your script it's more than burned.*
*So I created ReverseDuckyPolymorph to fight static detection. Everytime this payload will be used by your Ducky, the variables change and therefore are harder to pin point.*
*This of course is no guarantee for bypassing every AV, but it may help to bypass certain protections for a longer time.*
#
**Instruction**

Using ReverseDuckyPolymorph is easy and straight forward.
- First, start a listener on your attacking machine via the tool of your choice.
- Second, define the IP-Address and Port of your listening machine

- Third, compile the payload, using payloadstudio in version 1.3.0 minimum, transfer it onto your Ducky and you are good to go.
#
Every session you will gain via this payload will result in a different ID to verify a different pattern.
